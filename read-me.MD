FROM wp_options 
WHERE option_name LIKE '_transient_%';
```

## 7. Clean Up wp_postmeta Table

**Select Orphaned Post Meta:**
```sql

FROM wp_postmeta pm 
LEFT JOIN wp_posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id 
WHERE wp.ID IS NULL;
```

**Delete Orphaned Post Meta:**
```sql
DELETE pm 
FROM wp_postmeta pm 
LEFT JOIN wp_posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id 
WHERE wp.ID IS NULL;
```

## 8. Clean Up wp_commentmeta Table

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM wp_commentmeta 
WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT comment_id FROM wp_comments);
```

WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT comment_id FROM wp_comments);
```

## 9. Clean Up Spam and Unapproved Comments

```

## 10. Remove Unused Tags and Categories

**Select Unused Tags and Categories:**
```sql

FROM wp_terms t 
LEFT JOIN wp_term_taxonomy tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
WHERE tt.count = 0;
```

**Delete Unused Tags and Categories:**
```sql
DELETE t, tt 
FROM wp_terms t 
LEFT JOIN wp_term_taxonomy tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
WHERE tt.count = 0;
```

## 11. Remove Unused User Data

**Select Inactive Users (Example: Users who haven't logged in for a year):**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM wp_users 
WHERE user_login NOT IN (
  SELECT user_login 
  FROM wp_usermeta 
  WHERE meta_key = 'wp_last_login' 
  AND meta_value >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
);
```

**Delete Inactive Users (Be cautious with this!):**
```sql
DELETE 
FROM wp_users 
WHERE user_login NOT IN (
  SELECT user_login 
  FROM wp_usermeta

## Additional Tips
